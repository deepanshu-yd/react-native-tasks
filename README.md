This is a React Native job assignment project demonstrating core React Native concepts including:

## Features Implemented

1. **Login Screen** - Email and password inputs with validation
2. **Posts List** - Fetches and displays posts from JSONPlaceholder API
3. **Post Details** - Shows full post content when tapped
4. **Counter Screen** - Simple increment/decrement counter

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- TypeScript
- React Navigation
- Expo
- JSONPlaceholder API
- StyleSheet for styling

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the project: `npm start`
3. Run on device/simulator: `npm run ios` or `npm run android`

## Learning Features

Each component includes detailed comments explaining:
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- TypeScript interfaces
- Flexbox layouts
- Navigation patterns
- API integration
- Component composition

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
